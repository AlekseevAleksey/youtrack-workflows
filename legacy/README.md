Legacy Workflows List
=====================

What is here?
-------------
These workflows are written on old workflows API, which is deprecated since YouTrack 2017.3.
You may use these workflows in YouTrack 2017.3 and later, until the old API is not
abandoned. However, please consider checking workflows on `js` directory.

How to get it?
--------------
To use a ready workflow file in your YouTrack, please:
* Download a `workflow zip file`.
* Import the workflow to your project.

If you are a project administrator then import the workflow in Administration > 
Projects > _project_ > Workflows tab.
If you have system administrator permissions, then import the workflow in 
Administration > Workflow page and attach it to one or multiple projects.

You can also try any of the custom workflows listed below in our 
[YouTrack InCloud test instance](http://workflows.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/). 
All registered users get project admin permissions.
